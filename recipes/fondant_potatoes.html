    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fondant potatoes are an elegant side dish featuring tender, buttery potatoes with a crisp, golden crust and a luscious, creamy center. The cooking method involves a combination of saut√©ing and braising, resulting in a perfect balance of textures and flavors. The potatoes are first seared to develop a rich, caramelized exterior, then simmered in a flavorful broth, absorbing savory notes and becoming irresistibly soft.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients (for 6)</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 large russet potatoes (other varieties will not work as well)</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>a knob of butter (a 2 or 3 tablespoon size chunk)</li>
        <li>4 thyme sprigs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth or stock, more if needed</li>
     </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Peel and slice potatoes into thick rounds, about 1 to 1.5 inches in thickness.</li>
        <li>Heat a mixture of butter and oil in a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the potato rounds and cook for 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they develop a golden-brown crust.</li>
        <li>Pour in enough vegetable or chicken broth to cover the potatoes halfway.</li>
        <li>Add a few sprigs of fresh thyme or rosemary for added flavor.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low, cover the skillet, and let the potatoes simmer gently for 20-25 minutes, or until tender and the broth has reduced to a glaze.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes if needed, allowing the glaze to thicken further.</li>
        <li>Serve the fondant potatoes warm, drizzled with any remaining glaze from the pan.</li>
     </ol>
