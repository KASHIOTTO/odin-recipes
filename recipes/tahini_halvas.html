    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tahini halvas is a delightful Middle Eastern sweet treat with a rich, nutty flavor and a smooth, crumbly texture. Made primarily from tahini (sesame paste), this confection is sweetened with honey or sugar and often flavored with vanilla or cinnamon. Itâ€™s a perfect balance of sweetness and earthy sesame notes, making it an irresistible and satisfying dessert or snack.</p>
